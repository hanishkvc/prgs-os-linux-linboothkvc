Bugs
-----------
The code to execute which is copied to kmalloced location, doesn't seem to be flushed
to memory successfully always. This is also one serious issue affecting the kexec working
currently. Have to look at cache flushing kernel function which I have used properly
tomorrow and if required replace it or, have to move the code to copy to final location
in my code in innermost kexec after it disables interrupts and calls DSB and ISB (just to
be safe, even thou DSB and ISB doesn't seem to be helping here).

Also the patch to the kernel module by insmod support logic in kernel to resolve the
external symbols used in the module itself seems to be NOT fully flushed back into memory
from cache sometimes.
